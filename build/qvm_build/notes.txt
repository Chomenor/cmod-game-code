Build tool binaries are provided for convenience so you can run the build without any additional software.
If you would like to build the tools yourself, perform a standard compile of ioquake3 (https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3)
under cygwin/mingw. You should be able to locate the tool binaries created under the build directory.
